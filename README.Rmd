# covid19

## To deploy:

To deploy on a shiny server, simply place an `app.R` file in a folder as one normally would do, and populate that file with the following lines:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(covid19)
run_app()
```

To do this:
```
# Run the below once only
mkdir /srv/shiny-server/covid19
sudo chmod -R 777 /srv/shiny-server/covid19
echo "library(covid19); covid19::run_app()" > /srv/shiny-server/covid19/app.R
```

When re-deploying, you won't need to re-do the above. But you will need to remove the previous iteration of the app, reinstall, and restart the shiny server.

```
sudo su - -c "R -e \"remove.packages('covid19')\""
sudo su - -c "R -e \"devtools::install_github('databrew/covid19', dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)\""
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server

```
